Revision history for Test-Mini

v1.1.4  2015-07-??
        Set min perl version in all modules and dist metadata to 5.006.
        Previously Test::Mini required 5.008, but actually is fine with 5.006

v1.1.3  2011-02-12
        Found a bug causing erroneous behavior for skipped tests in Perl 5.13+.

v1.1.2  2011-02-10
        Fixed a bug in Makefile.PL that caused failures with older versions of
        ExtUtils::MakeMaker.

        Added a proper $VERSION to the Test::Mini package.

v1.1.1  2010-10-14
        Fixed a bug w.r.t. mro::get_isarev behavior.  Test::Mini would always
        try to run tests in any package that had ever been a subclass of
        Test::Mini::TestCase; this prevented Test::Mini::Unit's tests from
        passing under any Perl >= 5.9.5.  Few users will have seen this bug.

        Made another pass at making t/Test/Mini/Logger.t pass on the smokers.

v1.1.0  2010-09-30
        Implemented respect for the TEST_MINI_NO_AUTORUN environment variable

        Fixed a bug where invalid TAP was output when running multiple test
        cases in a single process

        Attempted once again to fix an intermittent failure in
        t/Test/Mini/Logger.t related to timings

v1.0.0  2010-09-16
        First Major Version
